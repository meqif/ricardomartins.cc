*EDIT*: This post has been obsoleted by Alfred 0.6.1. :)

Lately, I’ve been using "Alfred.app":http://www.alfredapp.com/ as my application launcher. I used to use Quicksilver, the grandfather of OSX app launchers but changed to "Google Quick Search Box":http://code.google.com/p/qsb-mac/, since Quicksilver had some problems (namely with Snow Leopard and Spaces). However, Google QSB(Quick Search Box) proved to be a little too slow for my taste, and Alfred showed up in Hacker News, so I gave it a shot. Couldn’t have been happier with my choice, even though it’s still in an early stage of development.

I still missed in Alfred something Google QSB(Quick Search Box) had: easily accessible system actions, like sleep, shut down, restart and lock screen. I like to avoid using the mouse whenever I can.

This wasn’t a problem. I took a look at the applescript Google QSB(Quick Search Box) uses internally[1] and created standalone apps based on each action, using Google QSB(Quick Search Box)'s icons[2].

I’m quite pleased with the result, since I got my beloved actions back and Alfred.app is still snappy.
